Having learned Ruby, I'm going through my JS course and spending a lot of time thinking, "WHY ISN'T THERE A METHOD FOR THIS????" I feel like I should have been more intentional about fully learning JS first, then learned Ruby and been happier with how much easier it is to get information from and play with everything. Yet instead, I'm getting frustrated and making comparisons.
Though I must admit, I've been a lot slower to learn through most of this course. I've spent DAYS going through one lab and spending more time on Google than on Atom. Stack Overflow has become my BFF. I'm going to pull back from Learn for a day. Spend some time on YouTube to hopefully get more familiar with the syntax, do's, and can'ts, then come back with the hope that I'll have a basic better understanding.
