I enjoyed doing this project a lot more than my first cli project. Being a big fan of movies, I kept the same theme. A social media platform for sharing movies you've watched, identifying whether or not you've liked them, and leaving a comment with your opinion on it. Something we all need!
Sinatra seemed a lot more straightforward for me. Create the route, follow the path, and build as errors come up. Though I referenced a lot of previous labs and relied heavily on video codealongs for proper structure and order. I handled issues a lot better on my project than I did many of the labs. And it WORKS!
I ended up adding a profile picture function as an option. To make it a bit more personal and fun. I wonder if people would really like to enjoy this app for real....
