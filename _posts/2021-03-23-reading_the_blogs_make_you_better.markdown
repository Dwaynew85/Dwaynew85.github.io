Starting out and growing through my code journey, I used to get SO MANY references to blogs and articles. I don't know about you, but I used to just open them in a tab and skim to the code snippet I needed at a particular moment. If I no longer needed the snippet, I closed the tab.

That was until recently, when I realized I had a TON of tabs open! Which people loved to remind me about when I screen shared. I decided to take an hour a day and go through a few of these tabs. Not just to pull specific code, but to refresh my memory on principles I learned and only used a couple of times. 

Not only did I get a refresher, yet by looking at how the author demonstrated syntax and use of different methods, I was learning more simple ways of building my apps! Even if the subject had nothing to do with it! It's true what they say! You can learn how to code better by watching other people code! And people code often in their blog posts! (Well...not this one, but you get it....)

Read the blog posts, pay attention to all of the code, learn and grow better.# Enter your title here
