The original plan was to create a CLI that listed the movies coming soon, the available details, and present a trailer link if one was available. Yet all the sites I wanted to use, used JS. I was having a hard time scraping from them. Then I finally found a list of information I could use! The top 20 highest rated movies was more interesting! I was able to use it off IMDB. I also had a hard time deciding which class would do what, and what they would do. I had to really think about what info I wanted and how to present it. Ran into challenges 40% of the way. When there was more than one writer, director, or genre, it would return arrays. A lot of "/n"s were included in them. Not the best a REGEX, so it was a bit of a struggle. Yet once I had the big picture in my head, getting the data got very simple. Forming them into readable strings started off difficult, but pulled through that as well. Things didn't come out perfectly. Still a few details here and there I could've tweaked, yet I'm exceptionally happy to have it working, running smoothly, and looking good!
