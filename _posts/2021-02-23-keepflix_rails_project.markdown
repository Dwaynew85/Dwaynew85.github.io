This was quite the stretch in my programming journey. Reading the lessons made perfect sense. Putting them together on a lab template made perfect sense, then when it came time to put it together.....
I liked the idea of expanding my Sinatra app with more features. Not just adding movies and liking/disliking them(in a very low-rate way). Yet commenting on the movies and giving opinions was a great addition. 
I added a comment model as a nested resource to the previous movie model. That still scraped from IMDB. With each user being able to comment on a movie that someone else posted, or that they added from their own collection of movies. With every user being able to add a movie to their own collection of movies. Whether they added it or not. A feature I didn't perfect in my Sinatra project(so many duplicates!!!)
I like how it came out, looking forward to adding more features to make it much more of a social platform surrounded around movies.
